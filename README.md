<h1>Neural Network Color Gradient (WIP)</h1>
<p>I started this project to start working with neural networks and artificial intelligence, it got a bit out of hands and I have focused too much on the visual interface. The project is not finished, as I was working in the project I realised this is not the best concept to start with in the artificial intelligence because as a user is difficult to see if something is actually changing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Functioning</h2>
<p>In the actual page of the project there is a little description of the correct usage of the tool, you can actually see the output values of the neural network on the browser's console. There is also an amount of times the neural network is going to search for a color, you can change that limit by changing the variable named tries, the default value is 50 tries, after that is going to show a color gradient although it thinks you might not like it.</p>
