<h1 align="center">Neural Network Color Gradient</h1>
<p align="center">This is a neural network that will show you color gradients that you might like</p>
<br/>
<p>I started this project to start working with neural networks and artificial intelligence, it got a bit out of hands and I have focused too much on the visual interface. The initial project idea is now finished although I can still work to improve it if someone has any suggestions. As I was working on the project I realized this is not the best concept to start with the artificial intelligence subject because as a user it is difficult to see if something is actually changing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Functioning</h2>
<p>On the actual page of the project, there is a little description of the correct usage of the tool, you can see the output values of the neural network on the browser's console. There is also an amount of times the neural network is going to search for a color, you can change that limit by changing the variable named tries, the default value is 50 tries, after that is going to show a color gradient although it thinks you might not like it.</p>
