<h1>Neural Network Color Gradient (WIP)</h1>
<p>I started this project to start working with neural networks and artificial intelligence, it got a bit out of hands and I have focused too much on the visual interface. The project is not finished, in fact the neural network is not even implemented yet.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Functioning</h2>
<p>In the actual page of the project there is a little description of the correct usage of the tool, the aim is to create a simple neural network that learns your color preferences as you decide if you like certain color combinations.</p>
